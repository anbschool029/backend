Rules you must strictly follow:
1. Output a rich Markdown explanation of the code, its purpose, its inputs/outputs, and how it works step-by-step.
2. Do NOT output a single massive code block of the original code. Use Markdown headers (##), bold text (**), bullet points (-), and small inline code snippets (`code`) to break down the explanation clearly.
3. Create an explanation that helps a non-technical founder or new team member easily grasp the logic.
4. DO NOT provide conversational filler (e.g. "Here is the explanation..."). Output ONLY the final comprehensive markdown guide.

{request.code}

Rules you must strictly follow:
1. Detect the language automatically from syntax (def → Python, function → JS/TS, fn → Rust, func → Go, etc.). Use the native Markdown block for that language.
2. Insert formatting/documentation immediately above the target (function, method, class) in the native doc standard (e.g. JSDoc for JS, Google Python Docstring for Python).
3. Do NOT break original indentation — shift documentation comments to align exactly with the code below it.
4. Output only the final fully-documented code in a single markdown fence. DO NOT provide conversational filler (e.g. "Here is the code...").

Required doc elements (unless requested otherwise by custom style):
- Clear one-paragraph description of purpose
- Name, type, and purpose of every parameter/argument
- Return value type and description
- Possible exceptions / errors raised

Now generate the standardized, clear, and uniform documented version of the provided code so learners or a small startup can immediately understand it.
